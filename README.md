# stonkbot
A basic stock/crypto trading bot

Stonkbot was my first python project and a great learning experience for me. The algorithm uses MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) to predict a price shift and buy/ sell accordingly. 

My main goal when creating Stonkbot wasn't to make a quick buck, but to deepen my understanding of python. The bot doesn't perform well so don't use it for investing purposes.

Looking back on it the coding and algorithm are pretty rudimentary, but I enjoyed coding it and the experience it provided me.
Hope you enjoy :)
